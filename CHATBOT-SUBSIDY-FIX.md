# 🤖 Chatbot Updated - Now Shows CORRECT PM Surya Ghar Subsidy

**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Issue:** Chatbot was giving outdated subsidy information  
**Status:** FIXED ✅ - Deployed to production

---

## ❌ Problem Detected:

User tested the chatbot and discovered it was giving **OLD subsidy rates**:

### What Chatbot Was Saying (WRONG):
```
❌ Up to 3kW: ₹18,000 per kW (max ₹54,000)
❌ 2 kW system gets ₹36,000
❌ 3 kW system gets ₹54,000
```

### Official PM Surya Ghar Rates (CORRECT):
```
✅ Up to 2kW: ₹30,000 per kW
✅ 2 kW system gets ₹60,000
✅ 3 kW system gets ₹78,000
```

**Impact:** Users were getting incorrect subsidy estimates, which could lead to:
- Confusion when they see calculator showing different numbers
- Loss of trust in our information
- Potential legal issues if users rely on wrong subsidy amounts
