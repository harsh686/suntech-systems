## 🔍 **How to Tell You're in Right Place:**

### **Team Settings (Wrong!):**
```
Settings (at top)
├── General
├── Billing
├── Build and Deployment
├── Members
└── Environment Variables ← Team-wide variables
```

### **Project Settings (Correct!):**
```
Project Settings
├── General
├── Build and Deployment  
├── Domains
├── Environment Variables ← PROJECT variables (you need this!)
├── Git
└── Functions
```

**The title should say "Project Settings" NOT just "Settings"**

---

## 🎯 **Quick Action:**

**Click the "Overview" tab at the top**, then click "Settings" again.

Or **scroll down** on the current page - if you see your variables already listed below, you're in the right place!
