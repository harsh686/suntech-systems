# 🔍 Debug Chatbot Issue - Check Build Logs

## ✅ **Deployment is Ready!**

Status shows: ✓ Ready (48s, Just now)

But chatbot still not working. Let's check the logs!

---

## 🔧 **Step 1: Click "Build Logs"**

**On your current screen:**

1. **Look for:** "Build Logs" section (you can see it with ⚠️ 2 warnings)
2. **Click:** "Build Logs" to expand it
3. **Look for:** Any red error messages
4. **Take screenshot** or tell me what errors you see

---

## 🔧 **Step 2: Click "Logs" Tab**

**At the top of the page:**

1. **Click:** "Logs" tab (next to "Deployment")
2. **Look for:** Runtime errors (red text)
3. **Filter by:** Error level
4. **Check:** Any "/api/chat" errors

---

## 🔧 **Step 3: Test API Key Validity**

The error earlier said `"User not found", code: 401` which means invalid API key.

**Let's verify the API key in Vercel:**

1. **Go to:** Settings → Environment Variables (from top menu)
2. **Find:** OPENROUTER_API_KEY
3. **Click:** "..." → "Edit"
4. **Verify:** The value is EXACTLY:
   ```
   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
   ```
   - No spaces before/after
   - Complete key (74 characters)
   - Starts with `sk-or-v1-`

---

## 🔧 **Step 4: Check Environment Variables Were Deployed**

**Sometimes variables don't get picked up. Verify:**

1. **Click:** "Deployment Settings" (you can see "3 Recommendations")
2. **Look for:** Environment Variables section
3. **Should show:** 4-5 variables loaded
4. **If empty:** Variables weren't deployed!

---

## 🆘 **Most Likely Issues:**

### **Issue 1: API Key Invalid/Expired**

**The OpenRouter API key might be:**
- Expired
- Typo during copy-paste
- Wrong key copied

**Solution:**
- Go to: https://openrouter.ai/keys
- Create NEW API key
- Replace in Vercel Environment Variables
- Redeploy

---

### **Issue 2: Variables Not in Production Environment**

**When you added variables, you might have selected wrong environment.**

**Check:**
1. Settings → Environment Variables
2. Each variable should show: "Production, Preview, Development"
3. If it only shows "Development" → Not in production!

**Fix:**
1. Edit each variable
2. Check all 3 boxes: ☑ Production ☑ Preview ☑ Development
3. Save
4. Redeploy

---

### **Issue 3: Wrong Variable Names**

**Variable names are case-sensitive!**

**Should be EXACTLY:**
```
OPENROUTER_API_KEY  ← Not openrouter_api_key
OPENROUTER_MODEL    ← Not OpenRouter_Model
```

---

## 🎯 **Action Steps:**

### **Do this NOW:**

1. **Click "Build Logs"** on current page
2. **Tell me:** Any red errors you see
3. **Then click "Logs" tab** (top menu)
4. **Tell me:** Any "/api/chat" errors

### **Then verify:**

1. **Go to Settings → Environment Variables**
2. **Screenshot:** Your environment variables list
3. **Show me:** All variable names and which environments they're in

---

## 💡 **Quick Test:**

**Let's verify the API key works at all:**

Open a new browser tab and try this:

1. Go to: https://openrouter.ai/
2. Sign in with your account
3. Check: Is your API key still active?
4. Check: Do you have credits/balance?

## 📊 **What I See:**

**From your deployment:**
- Status: ✓ Ready (good!)
- Duration: 48s (good!)
- Build Logs: ⚠️ 2 warnings (need to check these!)
- Environment: Production ✓

**But from earlier error logs:**
- `/api/chat` returns: `'User not found.', code: 401`
- This means: Invalid or expired API key

**Click "Build Logs" now and tell me what you see!** 🔍

**Or go to Settings → Environment Variables and screenshot the list!** 📸
