## üìä New Subsidy Calculation Logic

### Before (INCORRECT):
```typescript
// Wrong formula (copied from outdated sources)
if (systemSize <= 3) {
  centralSubsidy = systemSize * 18000; // ‚Çπ18,000 per kW
} else if (systemSize <= 10) {
  centralSubsidy = (3 * 18000) + ((systemSize - 3) * 9000);
}
```

### After (CORRECT):
```typescript
// Official PM Surya Ghar formula (verified Oct 2025)
if (systemSize <= 2) {
  centralSubsidy = systemSize * 30000; // ‚Çπ30,000/kW for 0-2kW
} else if (systemSize <= 3) {
  centralSubsidy = (2 * 30000) + ((systemSize - 2) * 18000);
} else {
  centralSubsidy = 78000; // Fixed ‚Çπ78,000 for 3kW+
}

// Special category states get +10%
if (specialCategoryStates.includes(state)) {
  centralSubsidy = centralSubsidy * 1.1;
}
```

## üîç Example Calculations

### Example 1: 2 kW System in Maharashtra (General State)
- System Cost: 2 √ó ‚Çπ45,000 = ‚Çπ90,000
- Central Subsidy: 2 √ó ‚Çπ30,000 = **‚Çπ60,000**
- Your Investment: ‚Çπ90,000 - ‚Çπ60,000 = **‚Çπ30,000**
- Note: "State subsidies may be available - verify with MSEDCL"

### Example 2: 3 kW System in Assam (Special Category)
- System Cost: 3 √ó ‚Çπ45,000 = ‚Çπ1,35,000
- Central Subsidy Base: (2 √ó ‚Çπ30,000) + (1 √ó ‚Çπ18,000) = ‚Çπ78,000
- Special State Bonus (+10%): ‚Çπ78,000 √ó 1.1 = **‚Çπ85,800**
- Your Investment: ‚Çπ1,35,000 - ‚Çπ85,800 = **‚Çπ49,200**
- Note: "Special Category State - additional 10% included"

### Example 3: 5 kW System in Gujarat (General State)
- System Cost: 5 √ó ‚Çπ45,000 = ‚Çπ2,25,000
- Central Subsidy: **‚Çπ78,000** (capped for 3kW+)
- Your Investment: ‚Çπ2,25,000 - ‚Çπ78,000 = **‚Çπ1,47,000**
- Note: "State subsidies may be available - verify with GEDA"

> "We only show 100% verified subsidies to avoid any confusion. Many websites show outdated or incorrect state subsidies. We prefer to under-promise and over-deliver - any state subsidy you get will be a bonus!"
